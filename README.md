# HX7App

A Mobile Lockscreen App with a Hexagonal Interface for the Lockscreen and UI

This App shall have 2 main Sections I wish to develop:

1. Lockscreen QR Interface

1. Quote of the Day
2. Quick List
3. Contacts QR Code
4. Website QR Code

The shape of the QR Code should fit within a custom a Hexagonal Shape or the QR Code outer region to be masked by the Hexagon Shape.

2. Home Screen Hexagonal UI

The User's Apps most frequently accessed Apps are organised within a Hexagonal UI with each adjacent Hexagonal Group accessed on each Perimeter Edge.

Each Hexagon would contain 7 Apps

1. Central could be Primary Play and Admin / Security Apps
2. Productivity Apps
3. Financial
4. Personal Development
5. Educational
6. Entertainment [ Movies / Music / Gaming ]
7. Social

e.g. Central Hex Tab [ 6 Out ] > Productivity [ Perimeter Tab 1 ] ( becomes the central focus ) [ 5 Out / 1 Back ] >  Productivity Tab 3 ( for additional App space )

For this Project I am using Visual Studio Community 2026 with Aspire using C#
